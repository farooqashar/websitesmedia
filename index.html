          <h2>Personal Websites</h2>
          <p>With the increasing dependence and usage of online social media networks and tools for schooling, productivity, and especially connecting, the idea of personal websites is growing more relevant by the day. Personal websites are a genre of media studies that have a variety of purposes, such as displaying one’s work for anyone to see and centralizing all relevant pieces of information of a person. These have existed for a while, but have evolved significantly partly due to the changing structure and usage of the world wide web. In addition, they now serve as an ever-growing essential part of one’s digital identity and personal branding. This idea revolves around the need of having a well-organized mechanism for showing who you are in order to not only get more future opportunities, but make important connections with other people for prosperity. Personal websites have formally institutionalized the art of digital personal identity.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>One specific area where personal websites are concretely affecting a community is college students and recently graduated college students at the forefront of entering the workforce. A more competitive job market means the opportunity cost of not having a personal website is slowly becoming necessarily high. There are only so many factors that can be considered in a job application, thus the number of factors that really cause distinction between candidates is low. Therefore, any additional unique content serves you well. This is analogous to many applications requiring optional project samples, writing samples, and cover letters. While they might not be a requirement, they can elevate one’s chances of securing the job. Modern job applications have normalized an input text field asking for a personal website link. While this field might not be a requirement as of yet, this webpage will point out that de facto, it might as well be.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>This webpage will argue that the genre of personal websites is here to stay as the widespread usage of the world wide web will make this genre a norm for gaining future connections and opportunities in addition to building a robust online digital identity. There will be information included on the evolution of personal websites in addition to a dissection of the interface/content of many personal websites. This website will also look closer at a case study of college students and recently graduated college students utilizing personal websites in order to enter the workforce successfully.</p>        </div>

          <h2>Evolution of Personal Websites</h2>
        </div>

        <h2><center>1990s</center></h2>

        <p>
          The internet phenomenon started to pick up speed in the 1990s when many Internet Service Providers enabled opportunities for some users to create a simple web page. Some web hosting services played a large role in this effort by providing guided structure and content for these sites. As Lev Manovich mentions in his The Language of Cultural Interfaces, a typical Human-Computer Interface(HCI) around 1997 would resemble a “magazine layout from the same decade (37).” The pages of the web page would be “dominated by text-headlines, hyperlinks, blocks of copy.” In the genre of personal websites, the early content was also in the form of text, such as to-do lists, basic creator information, and numerous links. The reach of this simple page was certainly limited in this time period early on as compared to the modern day, thus the intent while creating this page was not initially linked heavily with publicizing a personal brand. One example of a personal website during the late 1990s was Rob Malda’s Chips and Dips, which was a precursor to the Slashdot website during the eve of the dot-com bubble. As Michael Stevenson points out in his Slashdot, Open News, and Informed Media, Slashdot really paved the way for future Web 2.0 ecosystems by informating media via more visibility of metadata. The Chips and Dips site was meant to be a place where Malda can say what he wants freely. Of course, this can be theoretically seen by other people, which it was as the dot-com bubble raised the popularity and activity of Slashdot. Websites and personal online spaces were beginning to take off at the turn of the century.</p>

          <br></br>
        <h2><center>2000s</center></h2>

        <p>
          The turn of the century saw the growth of more intuitive web pages that started to incorporate the ideas of user interface and user experience, nominally known as UI/UX. User experience defines the way that a user interacts with a web page while the user interface is the space itself that allows the interaction to occur between human and computer. These ideas cannot be separated as articulated by J.P. Djajadiningrat, W.W. Gaver, and J.W. Frens in their research paper Interaction Relabelling and Extreme Characters: Methods for Exploring Aesthetic Interactions: “aesthetics and interaction are tightly interwoven, so that the aesthetics of a product must be shaped according to its functions and roles, and its interactions must be judged by their aesthetic qualities—both sensory and conceptual.” The webpage of the early 2000s was built for soft-scale documentation of one’s daily life, especially in the form of blogs. People shared their thoughts more and more on these digital spaces as they started to shape their digital identity. These were made accessible by an interface that allowed anyone to simply collect and publish their thoughts with the ease of several simple clickable actions, starting with elements of Slashdot. At the same time, there were other growing services that allowed creators to manage their content and build more and more layered web pages in a style known as Web 2.0 style, which revolved around text and media displayed on web pages with more user-centric and user-generated content.</p>

          <h2><center>2010s</center></h2>

          <p>
            There was a dramatic rise in the interactiveness of personal websites as the idea of them being mechanisms for maintaining a digital presence, defined as the compilation of one's online impression through their activity,  started to take serious shape. From amateurs to professionals, people were able to utilize growing user-oriented tools to customize their web page, such as by adding a comment section, contact page, and clickable images. Web 3.0 style allowed for dynamic media that is existent in today’s personal websites. Personal websites were slowly starting to be recognized for their role in centralizing all of a job candidate’s information for recruiters and hiring managers. In particular, resumes were starting to be hosted online for easier and more effective visibility. While this purpose was still relatively new, it would be only a matter of time when personal websites would increase in complexity, usage, and influence, especially in an economic sense. Competition in a capitalist society means that there are bound to be winners and losers. Personal websites can greatly shape the impression of employers, which often is a significant deciding factor for your application.</p>

          <h2>Job Market</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          It would be an understatement to state that today’s job market is competitive. The avalanche of a growing digital economy, automation, and accessibility of education on the world wide web, among others, is causing an increase in the number of qualified candidates. Of course, there are dramatic increases in the number of workers for certain rising fields like computer science, data science, and climate science, and decreases in the number of workers for certain less prominent fields like photography and philosophy, among others.

              <figcaption>Unemployment rates over the past 2 decades have been disturbed by 2 major economic events: the 2008 Great Recession and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with its massive closures. <a href="https://bebraven.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-9.24.12-PM.png">Source</a></figcaption></center>

            <br></br>

          <p>
            This was true before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and is even more true amidst the COVID-19 pandemic as the state of world affairs has uprooted the workforce. Corporations and businesses have had to lay off many people and/or keep only workers who are the most critical in its operations. According to the Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rates for college graduates and young workers hit the highest peaks of the past several decades last year. In addition, a study completed by the Wall Street Journal based on data from a labor-market analytic firm found that hiring for entry-level college graduate positions has fallen 45% since the start of the pandemic. While the outlooks for these groups are looking better, the economy takes time and the repercussions of the pandemic are going to last significantly long. In short, the job market is unstable and very competitive, especially in modern day due to the pandemic. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Even before the pandemic, the United States economy was one of the most competitive in the world, as displayed by the global competitiveness index of the World Economic Forum over the past decade. Competitiveness does not simply mean the unemployment rate as many factors determine the state of economic prosperity, which is often positively correlated with economic competitiveness. For instance, factors like quality of education, infrastructure investment, technological readiness, stability of financial markets, business sophistication, wellbeing, and human capital determine an economy’s competitiveness.

          <p>
            The state of affairs for the current job market suggests an even greater need for the genre of personal websites. In order to navigate the competitive job market, one would likely need to utilize the power of networking and connections in order to secure the next opportunity. In order to facilitate this, a personal website is an effective way of showcasing one’s personal brand to potential businesses and employers. We can see this due to a personal website’s singular location, faster speed, and more generated data/visibility. With the advent of many different social media networks, it can be hard to centralize one’s digital profiles in one singular location. Personal websites make it easier to customize one’s brand and showcase one’s projects, resume, skills, and more. As an example, imagine you want to share your coding experience via your GitHub profile, but also your technical writing samples on Overleaf. You would have to share pieces of your digital work in different spaces on the internet. However, you can have them all linked in a singular location with your customized preferences on your personal website to make this process seamless. 
          </p>

        <p>With a personal website that is not linked to a large social media conglomerate, there are no additional barriers to sharing it with anyone anywhere. Anyone who is not affiliated with you can also see your digital website. 
        </p>

        <p>With the power of this genre known to employers, it is now virtually a necessary step for one to have a personal web page that can be publicly accessed by employers and future connections. One can argue that larger companies simply do not have the means to review hundreds of personal websites. However, this dilemma is true regardless of other components of a candidate’s application. For instance, many larger companies also cannot process hundreds of resumes. Instead, some utilize newer technological tools like machine learning to narrow down the field to a manageable amount where human intervention is feasible. This can also likely be done with personal websites and is arguably better as there is simply much more data and metadata available from a personal website as opposed to a static resume. This can mean that the machine learning algorithms and other newer hiring tools are favorable to those who have more digital visibility, facilitated by a personal website for instance. 
        </p>
        <p>
      As Erin Greenawald mentions in her blog “How My Personal Website Helped Me Land My Dream Job” on The Muse, there are several important reasons why a personal website is becoming more of a normality day by day:

          <h2>Case Study</h2>
          <strong><p><center>Imagine you are a graduating college senior looking for an entry-level position. You have a robust LinkedIn account that you try to maintain in order to showcase your experience, skills, certifications, and education. You have not received any job offer yet. You have heard of the sentiment that personal websites can be a game changer to make you stand out and get you noticed for a job. You are trying to replicate and improve your digital presence from LinkedIn to a personal website. </center>        
          </p></strong>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this scenario, there are several different approaches at improving your digital presence and scoring greater visibility with the ultimate goal of securing the job opportunity. LinkedIn is one method for this. It allows you to have a systematic layout with different sections, like your skills and experiences, visible to anyone. You can also specifically connect with other individuals in a mutualistic manner and view their updates in an infinitely long scrolling feed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            However, many people around the world have LinkedIn and a LinkedIn profile to a recruiter is simply not as interesting as a personal webpage. Think of what appears more unique, rare, or clean: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashar-f-415249131/ or http://asharfarooq.com/. Which would you like to see first? A personal website is certainly growing in popularity, usage, influence, and visibility. However, many people still are not using it. Therefore, it can be a much more unique feature that can help you stand out from other individuals. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, a personal webpage can be much more accessible than LinkedIn. One instance is if someone does not have an easily available LinkedIn account in order to actually see your profile. In addition, a personal website is not largely maintained or managed by a specific social media network. With a customized web address, the possibility of creating a robust and extensive personal website with a high search engine rank is possible. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) includes factors that a personal website excels at over LinkedIn, such as user engagement, high-quality content, more target keywords, domain uniqueness, and crawlability (more usable and extractable metadata from HTML language, etc.). 
          </p>
          <p>
            There are other areas where a personal website’s experience is positively different from that of LinkedIn’s. For example, a personal website can make your resume stand out even more. It is a well-documented statistic that recruiters spend as little as 6 seconds looking at your resume. During this extremely short time, they are to determine whether you are a good candidate for a position and what you are about. With a LinkedIn profile, your resume is in a structured list form with options for including description, duration, location, and some other attachments. However, a personal website can fundamentally transform your resume to look like an aesthetically pleasing timeline of experiences with as much information as you want in it. Different animations, links, colors, font, font size, and other specifications can truly make your resume come alive and impress the reader with not just its aesthetic UI/UX, but also as a great means for them to learn about your style and experiences. In addition, you can also upload and link your resume to a singular location on the webpage, thus making it more accessible to anyone by simply providing a link. This can also make it easier for anyone to either download the resume onto their own computers or view it scattered through the webpage in a stylistic manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another distinction between a personal website and a LinkedIn profile appears in the form of one’s expression of thoughts on various topics, namely in the format of a blog. LinkedIn does not have a structured layout for including personal blogs/writing, especially without comprising the already rigid structure of a LinkedIn profile for different sections. Why is this important? Well, ask Rob Malda when he was creating his Chips and Dips website in order to share his opinions. Ask a recruiter if it is easier to gauge the interests of an individual via a static resume or through a candidate’s writings about the social issues of society or their photo gallery of their study abroad program in Europe. Ultimately, a story or a picture is worth significantly more in terms of expressing who you are than a paper resume of strategically concise descriptions.

            <h2>
              So...why do many people still not make a personal website? 
            </h2>
            <p>
              Given the anecdotal and statistical importance of a personal website in the modern economic world, many people still opt to not pursue this genre of expression. There are indeed barriers to making an entirely new website. A major concern is the start-up work and time that might be needed to plan out the structure and content of a website. Existing tools like LinkedIn have a set layout that does not require any additional changes or planning. On the other hand, a personal website gives you the full freedom of choices, which is often hard to manage in any sector. A possible approach at mitigating this barrier is using the power of open-source software and utilizing existing packages/templates that can serve as the base for your personal website. One might argue that this erodes the uniqueness factor that is so vital in personal websites. However, you can adapt the template or package in a manner that showcases your work and style. This is analogous to an individual cloning or “forking” a public GitHub software repository in order to work on their own features and product from a given baseline. The code that you write showcases your work in a manner similar to customizing a template for your personal website. 
            </p>

            <h2>
              So...why are people turning to personal websites at this particular moment in time? 
            </h2>

            <p>
              As seen from the evolution of personal websites since the 1990s, the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) of personal websites have improved dramatically. Advancements in understanding how to represent content online, rising popularity of the internet due to the dot-com bubble, and increased open-source software packages all helped lead the evolution of personal websites to more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing media spaces representing an individual.

              At the time of writing this, my screen time on my Macbook Pro was 16 hours and 37 minutes out of 24 hours in one day. What does this mean? Everything is virtualized. With the seismic shifting of everyday life to be virtual, there is an ever-increasing dependence on the internet for learning, selling, and also acquiring new opportunities. Everybody is more active online in seemingly an always-on mode. Due to this, it is important to have a robust digital identity in order for recruiters and others to be able to still find you virtually. This is where the uniqueness and accessibility of personal websites come into play. With significant improvements in features and interface over external platforms like LinkedIn, a personal website in this current time period is an effective way to get your digital identity in front of the eyes of the world and differentiate yourself during this time of economic urgency. Economic prosperity is not in order for many individuals during this time as even the latest job reports in May 2021 show the long road ahead for normal economic strength, which itself is competitive.

                  Having your own website allows you to control what people will find when they search for you. More and more, we hear that employers are Googling candidates to learn more about them. When you have your own website, you have an opportunity to demonstrate a portfolio of information about you and to provide further information (via links) so employers can learn more about you.

                  To have a personal website as your online portfolio is still the best way to stand out. Although employers do not make it a requirement, it does give them another opportunity to get to know you. Job seekers with online portfolios give employers another opportunity to know, trust, and like you. You will certainly increase their interest in you. The quality of your blog or website is essential. It is a preview of the quality of work you will deliver to them. </p>                  <img src="https://thevoiceofjobseekers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Mark-Anthony-Dyson-3.jpg" class="testimonial-img" alt="">
